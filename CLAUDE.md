- When working in this repo (dotfiles-nix), always check the `justfile` to see available commands
- To rebuild darwin in this repo, use `just mac` (which handles the darwin-rebuild process)
- Alternative: You can also use `nh`, so for a darwin-rebuild it'd be `nh darwin switch .`, and for home-manager, it'd be `nh home switch .`
- you don't need to call   Bash(hs -c "hs.reload()" 2>&1; sleep 2 && echo "✓ Reloaded - debug logging removed") to reload hammerspoon, rather, you don't have to sleep and echo anything; just call the reload, and then check that hammerspoon left a notification center entry in the notifications db for something like "hammerspork"
- check config.lua for locations of certain things, like the database
- when reloading hammerspoon, always just call to reload it, then check the notifications db for "reloaded" messages.
- when looking for paths to things for hammerspoon stuff, check config.lua first
- dont' sleep after an hs.reload; you only need to check to make sure the reloaded notification was stored; if it was, then it was reloaded or at the very least check for the ai agent notification was just in the console
